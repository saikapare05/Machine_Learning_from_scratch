# Machine_Learning_from_scratch
A collection of core machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using Python and NumPy, without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow. This repository is intended for learning purposes and aims to build a strong understanding of how machine learning models work under the hood.
